# South Florida Code Camp ASP.NET Core Demo
ASP.net Core 1.0 Demo from South Florida Code Camp 2016

This example project was used to demo ASP.NET Core 1.0. 

In this demo we walked through: 
* Creating an ASP.net Core project
* Uploading it Azure using git
* Pulling the project down to a Mac
* Editing the project on MAC using Visual Studio Code
* Compiling and running the project
* Finally pushing the updated project back up to Azure from the MAC
